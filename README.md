# Note-Taking-Website

This is a simple online Note Taking Website using vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML. This will also be my first Javascript project or you can say my first development project all together
There might be bugs all throughout the place so feel free to open an issue.
Also if you are able to better improve this website feel free to add a merge request

The website is currently able to do the following
- Take and Save Note
- Keep it open while running only

These things are yet to be done

- Keep the files saved in local directory for the time being
- Add the notes to a database
- ~~Implement functions to delete the notes-~~
- Many more .....
